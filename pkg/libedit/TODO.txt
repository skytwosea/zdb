libedit functions:
p31/32: #include <editline/readline.h>  ...  fns readline, add_history, history_length, history_list, 

libedit package:
replace current dependency in build.zig.zon with the debian/ubuntu one?

PkgConfig: I've seen this in others' Zig builds, can it be used for the configure step for libedit as well?
